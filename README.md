Project-Euler
=============

My progress on Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net) .
I am working on these problems to practice my python coding skills. I try to solve each problem as quickly as I can while being reasonably efficient with memory and computation time. I tend not to do much refactoring after I arrive at the answer, so some of the solutions, especially early on, are not the best examples of good programming practice. Also, I do not go back to check if old code still runs after I update a package containing code I'm reusing, some solutions may not run. That being said, if you are looking for highly readable and efficient solutions to these problems, there are better sources out there, but of course you should try to solve them yourself as the creators of the website recommend.
