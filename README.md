Project-Euler
=============

My progress on Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net) .

I am working on these problems to practice my python coding skills. I try to solve each problem as quickly as I can while being reasonably efficient with memory and computation time. When my code yields the correct answer, I immediatly abandon it and move on to the next problem without refactoring. Also, I do not go back to check if old code still runs after I update a package containing code I'm reusing, etc., so some solutions may not run. I hope to record my thought process in solving the problem rather than illustrate good programming practices (in this particular case anyway). That being said, if you are looking for highly readable and efficient solutions to these problems, there are better sources out there, but of course you should try to solve them yourself as the creators of the website reccomend.
